# Instructions to Execute the MATLAB Codes

- Each experiment contains one or more MATLAB user-defined functions.
- All the MATLAB user-defined functions, along with helper functions, are located within the respective experiment directory.
- Before executing any MATLAB code, **download** all the user-defined functions and helper functions into a **single directory**.
- To ensure smooth execution, make sure that this directory containing the functions is accessible from your MATLAB environment.
